# RPG Factory Project Overview
The purpose of this tool is to allow developers to encapsulate behaviour logic into 'Events'. These Events can be assigned to specific callbacks on any given Component, allowing each callback to have an unlimited number of possible behaviours without having to add any logic to the Component script itself. Read the [wiki](https://github.com/kmbeck/rpg-factory/wiki) for more info.

This project is sort of sleeping until I have a game to work on that can really put it through it's paces...if you have any questions feel free to reach out.
