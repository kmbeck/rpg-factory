# RPG Factory Project Overview
The purpose of this tool is to allow developers to encapsulate behaviour logic into 'Events'. These Events can be assigned to specific callbacks on any given Component, allowing each callback to have an unlimited number of possible behaviours without having to add any logic to the Component script itself. Read the [wiki](https://github.com/kmbeck/rpg-factory/wiki) for more info.
